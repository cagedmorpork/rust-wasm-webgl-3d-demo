## Fictionally Asked Questions

### Q: Why not fork from the project?

A: The whole point of this exercise was to replicate the code hands on. Which means typing everything by hand. In this way, I experienced errors and got familiarized with troubleshooting, and also trained some muscle memory. Works for me, kind of. Feel free to do otherwise.

### Q: What's notable about this implementation?

A: It's got comments, though I do not guarantee their correctness. It's like notes you'd find in a used text book.

I committed at "sensible" stopping points through the tutorial. Theoretically, if you were going through the tutorial and could not get it to work like in the video, and the completed repo was too different to your current progress, you could clone from here, jump to roughly where you are stuck, and diff. Beware of differently named variables/functions in some places.

In the end, it's mainly for my own benefit, in case I need to revise and my local copy goes kaput.

### Q: What's with the license?

A: Since this tutorial is based on his work, I just copied it straight from his repo.
